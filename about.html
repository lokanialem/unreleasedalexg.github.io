      <h3>about us</h3>
      <p>
        this website contains stuff alex never released in public because he didn't want to or didn't care or lost it or whatever. most of compilations in here are not official except Salt and C-Sides which alex sold on his tours. tracks were found mostly on youtube and myspace, some of them were given by alex friends. a bunch of tracks are of skin cells but renamed<br><br>
